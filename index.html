        We will start our story with my favorite player David Beckham whom I've met at a football game in Liverpool. It was the best
        day of my life and after that we went to Mcdonalds.

        After that we flew to Okinawa prefecture, Cape Busena where we went on a tour around the island and went swiming in the water.

        Then we went to Canada where we observed a herd of Mooses in the Canadian national park. It was so much fun.

        To finish this perfect day we went to Italy for a perfect cup of ice cream while watching the sun set down on the calm italian sea.
